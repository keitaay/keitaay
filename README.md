# Welcome to KÃ©ita's GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm KÃ©ita Yokoyama! I'm a biomedical engineer with a passion for accessible, user-friendly tools that tackle sensitive problems in medicine and society.

My GitHub contains a variety of projects, including some personal projects as well as open-source tools I've been involved with as a part of my day job as a PhD candidate in the Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering at UNC-Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University.

Take a look at my work, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions!

## About my website

This README is part of my personal website, which is hosted on GitHub Pages. The website is built using 11ty, a static site generator that's great for creating simple, fast websites. The website is built using a combination of custom-written HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to be simple, easy to navigate, and responsive across a variety of devices.

To create a local copy, download:

- A system with a modern web browser
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v. 22.0 or higher
- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) v.3.0 or higher
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to maintain consistent code formatting

Then run:

```
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```
