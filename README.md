# Welcome to KÃ©ita's GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm KÃ©ita Yokoyama! I'm a biomedical engineer with a passion for accessible, user-friendly tools that tackle sensitive problems in medicine and society.

My GitHub contains a variety of projects, including some personal projects as well as open-source tools I've been involved with as a part of my day job as a PhD candidate in the Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering at UNC-Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University.

Take a look at my work, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
