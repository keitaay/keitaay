# KÃ©ita's personal portfolio

This folder contains the source code for my personal website, hosted on GitHub Pages. The website is built using 11ty, a static site generator that's great for creating simple, fast websites. The website is built using a combination of custom-written HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to be simple, easy to navigate, and responsive across a variety of devices.

To create a local copy, download:

- A system with a modern web browser
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v. 22.0 or higher
- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) v.3.0 or higher
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to maintain consistent code formatting

Then run:

```
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```
